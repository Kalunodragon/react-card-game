TO-DO List at bottom of this file... for now
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Original plan of how game should run. This is just a broad overview, some parts might need to be modified or changed.

home screen is shown showing rules and if players are ready to play

deck is shuffled and split into two decks
these are then given to each player
create seperate playing hands - 5 cards off the top of each deck respectivly
  when a player is up have the hand show the current players hand
    once a card is selected have the window confirm if thats the card they want to play
    once confirmed have the card be played and then load the next player pass screen

next player pass screen has a button that when clicked progresses to the next player
  this then shows the hand of the next player with all the same options for the first player hand
  once a card is seleced and confirmed then the show war screen comes up

the Show war screen shows what player one decided to play and what player two decided to play
  these cards are then compared and the player with the higher power wins the round and both cards are added to their deck
    in the case of a tie "War" page is shown
      the first player gets a chance to choose a second card from whats left of their hand
      pass screen
      the second player gets a chance to choose a second card from whats left of their hand
      cards are shown again and compared
      
      winner gets the 3 cards left in the losers hand and all cards on table.
      in the case of a second war at this stage draw screen is show
        all cards on table are returned to original player in a shuffled state to the bottom of their decks
        5 new cards are drawn per player to replenish hand

  after compare winner takes cards (these are added shuffeld to the bottom of the winner deck) hands are replenished back to 5 cards in hand

  decks are checked to see that there are still cards playable from each deck
    if yes then play continues
    if no then player with more cards Wins the game
      win screen with player is shown
        total number of Battles/turns is shown
        option to reset and play again is given
          deck is reshuffled and redelt

    if players dont play again have the credits shown and a button to take players back to the main home screen
