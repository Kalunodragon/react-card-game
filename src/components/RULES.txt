If any component or item needs to be deleted please check with anonter group member
before deleting the component. Some parts might need to be accessed by another
component and if deleted it might break something else.
COMMENT OUT CODE FIRST! - DELETE only once you are sure it works without it!

Commit and push often! This will keep a good log of what is going on in case things
break as we are coding.

Update the discord and TO-DO list often! Especially if you are working on a few different
parts at the same time! There will most likely be a large number of things needed
for this full project to be completed!

Help one another out where we can! This is as much a learning expeariance as much as
it is a fun project! So help where you can!

Have code be readable! Leave Comments if you have to! Parts might need to be accessed
or used by someone else, this will help us know what everything is doing!

Before adding new Components make sure we dont have a component that already does what
is about to be added. Try and reuse components when possible.

If there are parts that you think you would be really good at or have a really good idea
for, please speak up! This is a positive environment, we should all support the ideas of
one another!



These are just ground rules, these may change as time goes on!
