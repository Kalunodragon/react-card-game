## Description of app:

This SPA is a React.js based app that allows a single player or two players to play a modified version of the card game WAR.
In this version the player(s) will be delt 5 cards off the top of the deck and will be given the chance to select
which card they will like to play each turn.

This app will use an AI built by us to act as the computer player. This Computer player will also be delt
5 cards from their deck to select which card to play. There will be a difficulty selection section that will
allow the player to choose how hard of a computer they would like to play against.
